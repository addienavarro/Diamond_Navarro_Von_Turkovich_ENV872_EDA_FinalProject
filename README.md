Course Project: Evaluating stream gauge data to determine flood risk of communities in North Carolina

Topic Information - With climate change being a major issue of society, we will begin to see more of an increase in natural disasters. This includes floods. In North Carolina, floods have already caused many issues throughout certain areas of the states. We are interested in looking at the existing stream data to determine the overall flood risk of disadvantaged communities with the hopes of helping to find solutions to mitigate these risks.
